 This paper establishes a general geometric framework governing the evolution of completely
irreversible systems at arbitrary distances from equilibrium, without assuming linear or quadratic
Onsager-type approximations. Using a non-quadratic, anisotropic geometric structure, we derive
a geometric evolution principle and an associated entropy principle that must be satisfied by all
relevant thermodynamic systems.
